## Challenge Description
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?


## Approach
Since this challenge also requires conversion, using [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html) is best.




## Step-by-Step Solution
1. After inputting 42, it'll output ``101010``, which is our flag: `picoCTF{101010}`.
