## Challenge Description
What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases.


## Approach
Since all of the previous challenges required the usage of CyberChef, we'll repeat the same step.




## Step-by-Step Solution
1. The string `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` is Base64. I found that out by going through all of the possible options for converting based on CyberChef. The Base64 option was the only one that produced a somewhat sensible string, which ended up being the flag: `picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}`
