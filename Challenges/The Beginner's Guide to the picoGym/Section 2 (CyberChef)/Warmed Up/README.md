## Challenge Description
What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?


## Approach
Since we're asked to convert from base 16 (hexadecimal) to base 10 (decimal), we have quite a few ways to solve this problem. I'll be using a site known as [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html). 



## Step-by-Step Solution
1. Ensuring that we're using the hexadecimal to decimal converter, we could just paste ``3D`` into the field, which will give us ``61``.

3. According to the hint, we'll need to put the output inside the picoCTF flag template. Hence, the flag is ``picoCTF{61}``
